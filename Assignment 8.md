I personally really found the [Discrete Math 1] Mathematical Induction video very useful because it was one of the topics I was not able 
to understand. During class I understood what was going on but I was having a hard time understanding why things were being done. The
video helped me understand that the whole point was to be able to prove that if the situation works for n then it would work for n+1
regardless of what n was. That was why we used k and then k + 1. It made it much more clear once I saw the way the whole thing was done.
